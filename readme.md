# Shuttle.rs Christmas Code Hunt 2024

This repository contains my [Shuttle](https://shuttle.rs/) project for the 2024 Christmas Code Hunt.

> [!NOTE]
> The project structure has been copied from my 2023 attempt [repository](https://github.com/supleed2/cch23-8bit/).

Handlers for each day is in the corresponding file in the [`cal` module](./src/cal/).

This project uses Axum and tries to stick with `std` as I'm trying to improve my Rust skills.
